      <p class="h5 line-height-5 mb4">With Baltimore I add another stamp to my passport of fascinating places that I&rsquo;d previously overlooked. Keeping my expectations chilled and out of direct sunlight keeps has been a winning strategy for unexpected delight.</p>
      <p class="h5 line-height-5">Note on the following: I&rsquo;ve spent 2.5 days here and no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
      <p class="h5 line-height-5">It&rsquo;s been many years since I&rsquo;ve been to the non-New York east coast. Visiting Baltimore has been a useful refresher. I found myself genuinely blown away on the first night by the very old buildings. The oldest building in California was built in 1994, the oldest in Baltimore was in the seventeen hundreds? Not exactly sure, but the city celebrates its 287th birthday this year.</p>
      <p class="h5 line-height-5">I bought a book on row houses on a whim the day before I flew out. Baltimore appears to have a special claim on the structures in that they have doubled down on them for centuries at this point. They&rsquo;re everywhere, they vary dramatically in style, and they are charming. Charm city and all that.</p>
      <p class="h5 line-height-5 mb4">I spend an inordinant amount of time thinking about the way cities are built and how people interact with them when I travel. Baltimore is really crushing it on urban fabric. Downtown and Mt. Vernon are very walkable, high density, there is a lot of variety and interest in the row houses and stately old buildings representing different architectual schools. There is also a shocking lack of restaurants, bars, cafes, and shops. There are a few, but nothing like what you&rsquo;d expect for such a dense, beautiful area. Also everyone drives.</p>
      <p class="h5 line-height-5">Planes, though.</p>
      <p class="h5 line-height-5">Baltimore is a composed of planes and blocks rhythmically stacked in beautiful compositions that change dramatically as you walk around the city. Abandoned blocks reveal the backs of row houses that sea saw in depth and height while maintaining a consistent form. Steeples, towers, and monuments and are dotted throughout the grid and always in view one way or another. Bushy green trees, angled roofs, detailed facades, balconies, brick sidewalks, and fire escapes provide a rich texture on top of the rigid stateliness of the buildings.</p>
      <p class="h5 line-height-5">People say places like San Francisco are beautiful. Compared to somewhere like Baltimore San Francisco feels surburban and private. The literal density of San Francisco is much higher than Baltimore&rsquo;s, but the streets and neighborhoods lack the depth and stature of Baltimore which echos a much more European notion of density and place. Big fan. Just needs 100x cafes and a good transit situation.</p>

      <h2 class="h5 line-height-4 regular underline">Highlights</h2>
      <ul class="h5 line-height-4 mb4">
        <li><span class="bold">American Visionary Arts Museum</span> — An eclectic museum celebrating outsiders creating art. These are folks that came at art from odd angles often late in life. The collection covers a wide range, but the Flatulence Post exhibit in the basement as well as the automata gallery are particular favorites. I&rsquo;ve never left a museum happier.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Baby&rsquo;s on Fire</span> — Coffee / record shop. Good coffee is tough to come by in Baltimore. This place has it. Also food + records + cool little mid-block street.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Row houses</span> — Just walk around and look at them. Each one is a gem.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Dooby&rsquo;s</span> — Had a tough time finding reasonable breakfast. This place has good, cheap, vaguely healthy things and passable coffee.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h5 line-height-4 regular underline">Otherlights</h2>
      <ul class="h5 line-height-4 mb4">
        <li>Be extremely skeptical of all new American type food. Pretty much consistently overpriced and undergood.</li>
        <li>Motorists do what they want.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">John and Frances Angelos Law Center at the University of Baltimore</span> — As a huge fan of weird architecture I was excited to see this weird patterned glass building poking out in the sea of brick. Upon closer inspection it&rsquo;s pretty disappointing. A whole skin of pointless decorative glass and by far the most sterile looking white classrooms I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</li>
