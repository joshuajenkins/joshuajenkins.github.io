The moment travel becomes real is when the airplane door opens and the first swirl of local air displaces some of the mumified germs you've been recycling with your fellow passengers for the past few hours. As you sleepily exit the plane and enter the jetbridge you get a quick sense of the temperature, humidity, and light. The walk to the exit of the airport sets you back a little, but then you approach the doors to the real, living, not-a-picture version of where you're going and you step outside.

Preconceptions dissipate as quickly as the stale air around you. Everything you heard, everything you expected, it's all irrelevant. You're physically standing in a new place and it's magical.

Athens immediately contradicts my expectations. The transportation is clean and modern (at least coming in from the airport), the written language is hilariously indecipherable, and it's not so hot that I start throwing a hissy fit.

A quick train ride takes you through generic looking suburbs nestled between golden hills that look a lot like northern California. You stay along the highway for a bit before dipping underground into sleek subway stations full of people. The central stations are packed.

The exit to the surface takes you another step towards reality. We exit at the Omonia station on the Metro #2 line and walk ten or fifteen minutes to our Airbnb. The sidewalks in this part of town are presumably a joke. They're wide enough for maybe one person, except that they're constantly obstructed by poles, cars parked one wheel on them, and other streetside tchotchkes. You spend as much time in the one land streets with other cars, mopeds and pedestrians.

Apartments hug the streets. Six stories tall on average, adorned with an impressively complete tapestry of graffiti. They themselves are hugged by balconies on every single floor. These are hugged with plants. Maybe more sat upon by.

Young adults and aging teens occupy the park—Exarchion—that our Airbnb is on. It's a small, triangular park, that serves as the central hangout spot for some of the fifty-five percent of unemployed people under the age of twenty-five in Greece. If a man we met later in the trip is to be believed, it's also the hangout of the Greek communist party.

Finally the voice over narration of the from the airport ends and we enter our Airbnb. Our host is nice, of course, and quickly leaves after waving her hands at walls and beds and things, explaining that yes, these are her walls and beds and things to we ought to go ahead and wave our hands at them or whatever we like.

Sadly this was the only apartment we stayed in for our entire trip, so I am forced to draw many conclusions from my sample set of one. Extrapolating from this apartment: all Greeks live on parks; they all have lovely balconies; they have nice simple bedrooms with large overhead fans and no air conditioning; they have small kitchens and bathrooms; they collect books about fashion in architecture in multiple languages; and they have toilets which cannot accept toilet paper. 

Tangentially, this is the eighth-ish apartment I've stayed in on trips throughout Europe and I figuratively cannot recommend it enough.

My lingering takeaway from Athens is that it feels healthy, like it was built for people to live there. Admittedly, most of my observations stand in contrast to my experience in the states. The aforementioned six story buildings are basically everywhere in Athens. The streets are narrow, run at odd angles, and are lined with apartment and office buildings with rarely a gap between them. The balconies feel like an extension of the street on some level. The narrow sidewalks often give way to pedestrian only streets or greater avenues that are blanketed with cafes.

You can be walking just about anywhere in the central city and within a few feet stop at a cafe on the sidewalk. Take a seat and someone will come out to you. There won't be any rush, but it isn't so slow as to be frustrating. You can order as little or as much as you like and no shits are given. The magic of not working for tips, I suppose. There will be a handful of people at the other tables and constant foot traffic on the street.

People inentionally speak in Greek as they pass by so that I can't understand them, but there's always some impression that there are people around you and I find it quite comforting. The food doesn't hurt either. It's all seasoned with oregono and olive oil. Underneath that you'll find fresh vegetables, generally tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, bell peppers, and olives. Fish grilled simply is easy to find and delicious. Feta cheese is here and there. The baseline for food in Athens (and all of Greece that I saw) is very high. Nothing was ever very mind-blowing or pretentious, it was just solidly good almost universally.

I say almost because of the pastries and bready dishes. I remain relatively ambivalent about philo dough and it's various uses, but I am resolved in my distrust of the little dry, crumbly, deceptive dough ring / pretzel looking things. I will also spend my remaining years avoiding Musaka and its ilk. It is 2015. Let's chill with the whole meat pie situation. Maybe send it back to the dark ages where it belongs.

Athens' other major feature is its history. Pitchfork recently gave it a B+ on history, so it's worth taking a look. Our first experience with this was the second day as we walked down Aiolou street. We'd been walking down the street a few blocks when one of us thought to look up and, oh, there's the old columny thing we would later learn was the Parthenon, resting upon the big hill thing which ended up being the Acropolis. Even better, both of these things end up being quite old.

Appropriately impressed by these famous landmarks, we continue our walk a few feet and notice a pit next to us. A pit full of ancient Greek things of lesser note than the stuff on the Acropolis, but apparently still worthy of keeping. Mostly little foundations and some fallen pillars and the like behind a fance. A few more steps and there are pitched glass cielings on the ground revealing the ancient Athenian city wall beneath it. A few more blocks and there's a Starbucks. Really, it's all quite impressive.

We sauntered up the northern hill to the Acropolis the following day. We were walking around some very beautiful hilly neighborhoods when we saw this little path with a hut blocking the entrance. Thirty seconds and twelve euros later we're walking up this little tiny dirt trail with signs indicating that this or that structure was built two thousand plus years ago and the transition was too quick to really take it in. One minute you're walking through cafes, the next you just kinda plopped into a history book.

Luckily, a few steps farther we encountered our eight billion tourist compatriots and all was right in the world. It turns out there are entrances all around the Acropolis and we lucked out with a tucked away one. While there were in fact eight billion tourists as I mentioned, it never felt too crowded save for the occasional choke point because most of the park is wide open and you can walk where you like. I was expecting the worst, having never been to a super-significant tourist destination before, but it was all reasonable.

The Parthenon and other buildings on or near the Acropolis are really worth checking out, as trite as that sounds. I honestly considered skipping it out of tourist-dread but I'm very glad I went. It's impressive, staggering, and most of all interesting. Greek history is interesting because of its pinnings as the philosophical root of most of western culture and religion. The buildings, still in remarkable shape all things considered, are an expression of those rich times and it's a beautiful thing that they're still accessible. Also, as a design-minded person there are no shortage of intentionally and beautifully crafted things to gawk at.

The New Acropolis Museum deserves some times as well. Aside from being an absolutely gorgeous museum, it also stitches together two phenomenal Greek accomplishments, that is the museum itself and the adjacent Acropolis. Of the museums throughout the world that I've visited, this one stands out as particularly special. It's extremely well integrated into the neighboring area, the contents within (and underneath) are mind blowing, the architecture is top notch, and the cafe is bananas.

Our time in Athens was short. Just two full days at the beginning and about the same at the end of our trip. It's a hard place to get to, but I'd love to go back and dig deeper into the culture. We were also there in the middle of the Greek financial and political crisis, just before the referendum to vote on the "final" austerity measures proposed by Greece's lenders and then actually on the day of the vote. It was a historic time to be there, and it was definitely in the air, but the locals kept us shielded from it in order to keep the tourist dollars flowing in. Regardless of what happens, I hope the best for the people of Greece who seem to have little recourse in the dealings of the centralized political and economic powers that dicate the paramters of their livelihoods.

Some Athenian highlights:

- **Taf Coffee**—Supposedly the best coffee in Athens. It's one of a handful of places you can get coffee prepared with some intentionality plus you get to hang out on the sidewalk next door to the cafe with old folks shooting the shit.
- **Six Dogs**—Huge terraced back yard patio with olive and citrus trees. Drinks and okay, food is not great, but the space is well worth it to for a break from the heat. It's gorgeous.
- **New Acropolis Museum**—Already mentioned above, but you're going to get worn out at the Acropolis. Do yourself a favor and grab a bite and a drink here, then check out all the amazing artifacts to help put your Acropolis experience in context.
- **Τράτοα**—Seafood spot near Exarchion park. I think it might translate to "tratoria" in English. Everything we had here was delicious including the herring salad, fisherman's soup, and grilled octopus.
- **Η Κρητη**—"I Kriti" in English. Traditional Cretan food in a weird little mall. This was the best meal we had in Athens by far. Rich, delicious, interesting food. Nice service. Extremely low key. We had the homemade wine and lamb and potatoes. The waiter took shots of raki with us, on the house.
- **Raki & Ouzo**—Since I mentioned raki. Raki is paint thinner. The Greek grappa. It's intense, but if someone offers it to you, why not. Ouzo is flavored raki if I understand it correctly. It tastes like anise and generally comes with ice. It's cheap and you can sip it while you're figuring out your next move is at a cafe.
- **Black Duck Garden**—If you find yourself near the National Library and related places and need to escape the heat and commotion, check this place out. I think it's part of a hotel but it doesn't matter. It's a huge patio space with citrus trees growing all over the place. They have nice sandwiches and drinks.
- **Thision Open Air Theatre**—Right next to the Acropolis on Apostolou (which is worth strolling along on its own) is an open air theatre. It's low key, has plastic chairs, drinks and snacks. It's nice to sit outside and watch a movie, many of which are in English with Greek subtitles.
- **Not trying too hard**—Just walk around and get a feel for everything. Stop, have a bite and a drink, and keep going. Athens rarely disappoints. I went to dozens of cafes, restaurants, and bars and had a nice time at almost all of them.
- **Actually going to Athens**—Athens doesn't have the best reputation for reasons that I can only assume are antiquated. You're better than that. Go for more than just the old stuff, it's a lovely city.
