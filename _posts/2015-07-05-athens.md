The moment travel becomes real is when the airplane door opens and the first swirl of local air displaces some of the mumified germs you've been recycling with your fellow passengers for the past few hours. As you sleepily exit the plane and enter the jetbridge you get a quick sense of the temperature, humidity, and light. The walk to the exit of the airport sets you back a little, but then you approach the doors to the real, living, not-a-picture version of where you're going and you step outside.

Preconceptions dissipate as quickly as the stale air around you. Everything you heard, everything you expected, it's all irrelevant. You're physically standing in a new place and it's magical.

Athens immediately contradicts my expectations. The transportation is clean and modern (at least coming in from the airport), the written language is hilariously indecipherable, and it's not so hot that I start throwing a hissy fit.

A quick train ride takes you through generic looking suburbs nestled between golden hills that look a lot like northern California. You stay along the highway for a bit before dipping underground into sleek subway stations full of people. The central stations are packed.

The exit to the surface takes you another step towards reality. We exit at the Omonia station on the Metro #2 line and walk ten or fifteen minutes to our Airbnb. The sidewalks in this part of town are presumably a joke. They're wide enough for maybe one person, except that they're constantly obstructed by poles, cars parked one wheel on them, and other streetside tchotchkes. You spend as much time in the one land streets with other cars, mopeds and pedestrians.

Apartments hug the streets. Six stories tall on average, adorned with an impressively complete tapestry of graffiti. They themselves are hugged by balconies on every single floor. These are hugged with plants. Maybe more sat upon by.

Young adults and aging teens occupy the park—Exarchion—that our Airbnb is on. It's a small, triangular park, that serves as the central hangout spot for some of the fifty-five percent of unemployed people under the age of twenty-five in Greece. If a man we met later in the trip is to be believed, it's also the hangout of the Greek communist party.

Finally the voice over narration of the from the airport ends and we enter our Airbnb. Our host is nice, of course, and quickly leaves after waving her hands at walls and beds and things, explaining that yes, these are her walls and beds and things to we ought to go ahead and wave our hands at them or whatever we like.

Sadly this was the only apartment we stayed in for our entire trip, so I am forced to draw many conclusions from my sample set of one. Extrapolating from this apartment: all Greeks live on parks; they all have lovely balconies; they have nice simple bedrooms with large overhead fans and no air conditioning; they have small kitchens and bathrooms; they collect books about fashion in architecture in multiple languages; and they have toilets which cannot accept toilet paper. 

Tangentially, this is the eighth-ish apartment I've stayed in on trips throughout Europe and I figuratively cannot recommend it enough.

My lingering takeaway from Athens is that it feels healthy, like it was built for people to live there. Admittedly, most of my observations stand in contrast to my experience in the states. The aforementioned six story buildings are basically everywhere in Athens. The streets are narrow, run at odd angles, and are lined with apartment and office buildings with rarely a gap between them. The balconies feel like an extension of the street on some level. The narrow sidewalks often give way to pedestrian only streets or greater avenues that are blanketed with cafes.

You can be walking just about anywhere in the central city and within a few feet stop at a cafe on the sidewalk. Take a seat and someone will come out to you. There won't be any rush, but it isn't so slow as to be frustrating. You can order as little or as much as you like and no shits are given. The magic of not working for tips, I suppose. There will be a handful of people at the other tables and constant foot traffic on the street.

People inentionally speak in Greek as they pass by so that I can't understand them, but there's always some impression that there are people around you and I find it quite comforting. The food doesn't hurt either. It's all seasoned with oregono and olive oil. Underneath that you'll find fresh vegetables, generally tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, bell peppers, and olives. Fish grilled simply is easy to find and delicious. Feta cheese is here and there. The baseline for food in Athens (and all of Greece that I saw) is very high. Nothing was ever very mind-blowing or pretentious, it was just solidly good almost universally.

I say almost because of the pastries and bready dishes. I remain relatively ambivalent about philo dough and it's various uses, but I am resolved in my distrust of the little dry, crumbly, deceptive dough ring / pretzel looking things. I will also spend my remaining years avoiding Musaka and its ilk. It is 2015. Let's chill with the whole meat pie situation. Maybe send it back to the dark ages where it belongs.

Athens' other major feature is its history. Pitchfork recently gave it a B+ on history, so it's worth taking a look. Our first experience with this was the second day as we walked down Aiolou street. We'd been walking down the street a few blocks when one of us thought to look up and, oh, there's the old columny thing we would later learn was the Parthenon, resting upon the big hill thing which ended up being the Acropolis. Even better, both of these things end up being quite old.

Appropriately impressed by these famous landmarks, we continue our walk a few feet and notice a pit next to us. A pit full of ancient Greek things of lesser note than the stuff on the Acropolis, but apparently still worthy of keeping. Mostly little foundations and some fallen pillars and the like behind a fance. A few more steps and there are pitched glass cielings on the ground revealing the ancient Athenian city wall beneath it. A few more blocks and there's a Starbucks. Really, it's all quite impressive.

We sauntered up the northern hill to the Acropolis the following day. We were walking around some very beautiful hilly neighborhoods when we saw this little path with a hut blocking the entrance. Thirty seconds and twelve euros later we're walking up this little tiny dirt trail with signs indicating that this or that structure was built two thousand plus years ago and the transition was too quick to really take it in. One minute you're walking through cafes, the next you just kinda plopped into a history book.

Luckily, a few steps farther we encountered our eight billion tourist compatriots and all was right in the world. It turns out there are entrances all around the Acropolis and we lucked out with a tucked away one. While there were in fact eight billion tourists as I mentioned, it never felt too crowded save for the occasional choke point because most of the park is wide open and you can walk where you like. I was expecting the worst, having never been to a super-significant tourist destination before, but it was all reasonable.

The Parthenon and other buildings on or near the Acropolis are really worth checking out, as trite as they sound. I honestly considered skipping it out of tourist-dread but I'm very glad I went. It's impressive, staggering, and most of all interesting. Greek history is interesting I think mostly because of its pinnings as the philosophical root of most of the western world and religions. The buildings, still in remarkable shape all things considered, are an expression of those rich times and it's a beautiful thing that they're still accessible. Also, as a design-minded person there are no shortage of intentionally and beautifully crafted things to gawk at.

Our time in Athens was short. Just two full days at the beginning and about the same at the end of our trip. It's a hard place to get to, but I'd love to go back and dig deeper into the culture. We were also there in the middle of the Greek financial and political crisis, just before the referendum to vote on the "final" austerity measures proposed by Greece's lenders and then actually on the day of the vote. It was a historic time to be there, and it was definitely in the air, but the locals kept us shielded from it in order to keep the tourist dollars flowing in. Regardless of what happens, I hope the best for the people of Greece who seem to have little recourse in the dealings of the centralized political and economic powers that dicate the paramters of their livelihoods.

Athens rests upon narrow streets, lined with graffiti, cafes, and little shops selling anything from books (very common) to cigarettes and electronics. Roads run at all angles and intersect in odd patterns. In some neighborhoods "sidewalk" is a generous term for the foot-wide walkways with cars parked half-upon them or poles blocking the way. You often find yourself sharing the street with pedestrians, hatchbacks, and scooters. Like most other European cities, there is a simple, effecient subway and tram system.

Foliage dominates the streetscape. Lush, happy plants take the heat in stride and bear colorful fruits and flowers.

The buildings are cheap and terraced. Six stories seems to be the de facto height for most apartment buildings. Every building is encased in balconies—often overflowing with greenery. Coupled with the activity on the ground level Athens feels, in total, lived in. It's an energizing and healthy feeling that makes me sad that we build cities so differently in the states. Difficulties aside, Athens is a beautiful place to simply be.

Take for example the cafe and restaurant culture. I haven't sat inside to eat more than a couple of times in my entire trip to Greece because there are places outside to eat practically everywhere. Sidewalks are lined with tables, parks and squares hold an assortment of eateries and bars touching each other shoulder to shoulder, often blurring together if not for the slightly different colored chairs or awnings (white, off-white, or light brown).

I heard from a number of people back home that Athens is dirty. I've read that the city has cleaned itself up somewhat in recent years, so I might be speaking out of turn, but the city has much more dominate attributes than its slight dirtiness. There's an unfortunate amount of trash in some streets and parks, but by and large its as clean as any major city. I've seen 100% less human shit in the street the entire time I've been here than I do on any given day in San Franciso.

Unemployment in Greece is apparently around 55% for people under 25. This feels obvious in Exarchion park, where young people sit on every available surface in the park covered in graffiti, smoking, talking, and drinking beers from the small convenience stores around the park. Older folks seem to spend their time at cafes rather than parks, but in both cases it seems like there is a lot of idle time in Athens to be spent talking about current events over coffee—frappe for the younger, espresso for the older.

Another perhaps notable thing about Athens is the history. The Acropolis, tourists be damned, is incredible. It's very hard to process how old the things are; some buildings are older than your mother. Having never visited places of extreme cultural heritage I was a bit surprised to be walking to breakfast the first morning and to see the Parthenon sitting on top of a hill, just a ten or fifteen minute walk ahead of us.

There is something awful about that saturation of famous landmarks in media once you get to them in person. Something akin to a song that might have been good but now it's really more of a forgettable yogurt ad tune. It makes it (for me, at least) very hard to feel the weight of what I'm looking at, like I can't distinguish between the real thing and a fascimile. It takes some intentional internal struggle to force my mind to accept the fact that I'm standing where Aristotle once stood and that I'm looking at buildings he looked at. This is one of my struggles with travel, and Athens has made the feeling more acute than other destinations.

Columns aside, there is also food in Athens! It's quite good. It tends to be simple dishes heavily seasoned primarily with oregano. Lots of olive oil on everything. Salads are big chunks of tomatoes and cucumbers with feta cheese, bell peppers, and olives. Souvlaki is just grilled meat, usually on a skewer, with some french fries. There are some heavy baked savory pastries that I mostly steered clear of. Drinks (when not having food) always come with a little snack, generally stale chips. I've eaten more Doritos in Athens than I ever have in the US. Ouzo comes with ice and is stupid cheap. I wish there was an American equivelant to grabbing a $2 drink at an outdoor cafe in the evening and just chilling out.

Greek food reminds me of Mexican food in that there are relatively few ingredients but it never really gets old and it's all very tasty. I'd take a place with universally decent food over somewhere that takes effort and money to have a good meal, such as say, ahem—San Francisco. That being said, Athen's pastry game is a tragedy, there are these dough rings with sesame seeds which look like pretzel bagels but in actuality are dry, crumbly, gross food imposters.

Luckily, though disappointingly, every Greek menu I saw came with English translations. Greece is the first place I've visited where I don't recognize the alphabet. It's not so different from English, although there are some difficulties like "P" being pronounced "R" and some of the familiar lower case letters being pronounced as completely unrelated letters. It's fun trying to decode (e.g. pronounce) words in Greek and not as tough as I expected. The Greek alphabet is quite beautiful, it has dramatic diversity with strong, geometric shapes and fluid caligraphic shapes.

![Syntagma Square](/img/2015-athens/syntagma-resize.jpg "Syntagma Square")
{: .image }

We spent a good deal of our last day in Syntagma Square, the central square of the city next to where the Greek Parliament resides. It's the unofficial rallying point of the "No" party for the referendum taking place while we sat in an outdoor cafe and watched people milling about. A couple of days before we got back there were clashes in the square with police using teargas to disperse rallying crowds and some reports of arson nearby.

The current president and radical left party (Syriza) leader has spoken here repeatedly urging the Greek people to turn down the austerity measures proposed by the EU in an effort to force creditors into a less powerful position than they held before the referendum was called a week prior. A couple of hours before polls close the media started swarming as more people filled up the square. We left shortly after the polls closed as the square was starting to fill up.

The "No" vote in the referendum was called later in the night with a decisive 60/40 victory and Syntagma Square was turned into a place of celebration. At the time of this writing it's unclear what the vote means for Greece, there has been talk about this forcing Greece out of the Euro or even the European Union entirely. It seems that neither side wants this, the Greek people seem to just want to return to normalcy, but they're stuck in a sea of high-stakes political and economic maneuvering. What the vote causes to happen will be clearer by the time I publish this, but I'll leave this in an indeterminate state because that was the feeling of the city and the people while we were there.

Finally, a special shout out to the Greek sewage system which is too delicate to handle paper products. Every restroom has a basket with a lid.

Some Athenian highlights:

- **Taf Coffee**—Supposedly the best coffee in Athens. It's one of a handful of places you can get coffee prepared with some intentionality plus you get to hang out on the sidewalk next door to the cafe with old folks shooting the shit.
- **Six Dogs**—Huge terraced back yard patio with olive and citrus trees. Drinks and okay, food is not great, but the space is well worth it to for a respite from the heat.
