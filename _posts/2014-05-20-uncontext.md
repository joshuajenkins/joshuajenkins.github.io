Something like a decade ago when I was in high school I would spend my time online looking at Flash experiments. Enticed by the sense that with just a little ActionScript, I, too, could create these beautiful moving works of art on an otherwise static web.

I would visit galleries of generally math-based Flash experiments and absorb the coolness. Wonderfully, some of this stuff still exists out there, like Jared Tarbell's [Levitated](http://www.levitated.net/daily/), Grant Skinner's [experiments](http://incomplet.gskinner.com/index2.html#landscape), and some of the miscellaneous stuff on Kirupa Chinnathambi's [eponymous forum](http://www.kirupa.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?64-Source-Experiments) (you'll probably need to page back a few years.)

Fast-forward past the remainder of puberty, me abandoning most things artistic, a few jobs, a few cities, and nine-thousand burritos when [John Brown](http://thisisjohnbrown.com) asks me to help out with [Uncontext](http://uncontext.com) during a surprise visit to San Francisco.

Uncontext, to me, has the same spirit of those oldschool Flash experiments, except it adds this interesting dimension that is a single live stream of seemingly random data that every collaborator builds against. So whatever crazy thing you build is going to be completely in sync and will react with the same rhythm as what everyone else has made for that session. There's something beautiful about that, everyone exploring his or her own personal artistic expression while implicitly working as part of a group, creating a body of work.

The data source is also interesting. John's been a bit coy about this so far, but the basic idea is that the data just *looks* random. It's actually pulled from some source and modified to look random. At the end of each session (session 1 is "Literature") the datasource will be revealed. Neat.

Now, the barrier to entry is sufficiently low (Flash, may you rest in peace) that anyone with the desire to produce a piece can do so without too much trouble. Amazing things like [d3.js](http://d3js.org), [threes.js](http://threesjs.org), [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com), [Processing](http://www.processing.org), [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/), [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), and myriad others provide a foundation to easily build upon.

I've focused primarily on the data visualization and experimentation side of things in describing Uncontext, but in reality it's open to literally anything that uses the data stream as an input and produces some output. Hook a Raspberry Pi up to a toaster and toast a piece of bread every time d equals 5. The sky's the limit.

Reach out on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/joshuajenkinsyo) if you have any questions. More details to follow. I'm exited about this.
