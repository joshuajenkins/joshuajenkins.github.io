I traveled to Mexico City in December 2013 for five nights. I originally wanted to create something phyiscal like a book or a zine to commemorate the trip, but that is hard so here we go.

If you multiplied the above image by ten million you'd get a reasonable idea of the size of Mexico City. The city is huge. Wikipedia tells me that it might be larger, by population, than New York City. Apparently there's some sort of global pissing match for largest city, but suffice it say, this city is pretty not small.

This is the Airbnb we stayed in. It was 40 pesos per "noche" which is something like 40 U.S. dollars per noche. Whoops no in fact, shit, this was actually at the anthropology museum which was huge and awesome and had the worst food in the city. Pictured is a traditional dwelling from some distant, pre-columbian time (probably, I didn't write down any notes).

Alright so that's the real Airbnb. It was much more hipster than I anticipated. Our host was an architect named Chimi and he was great. He hung a huge map of the neighborhood on one wall and labeled all of his favorite places. They were all good. If you see Chimi, do something aggressively American to express your appreciation to him in a culturally insensitive way (don't though).

The apartment was confusingly on the border Hipodromo and Contessa, both borough-level neighborhoods. Contessa is the Mission of Mexico City if you trust the Google. It's not a horrible analogy, it's vaguely hipster with a lot of bars and young, affluentish Turd Furgesons.

Most of the D.F. that I saw looked something like the above. Somewhat cheaply built 2 - 6 story buildings, intermixed with bright colors, some newer construction, lots of trees, and street surfaces in moderate repair. Also, bike lanes. Mexico City appears to be appreciate the bicycle, though I can't imagine it's particularly enjoyable cycling at 7,000 feet with awful air quality.

Despite the less-than-great air quality, green is everywhere. The greenscape (is that a thing) is dry and crunchy, while still being lush. It's a funny dichotomy, everything looks greener than it feels. Still, it's beautiful.
