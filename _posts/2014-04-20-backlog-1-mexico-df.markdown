I traveled to Mexico City in December 2013 for five nights. I originally wanted to create something phyiscal like a book or a zine to commemorate the trip, but that is hard so here we go.

Mexico City is big. Wikipedia says that it might be larger, by population, than New York City. Whoever the global pissing match for city sizes deems the winner aside, D.F. is big, and it has the air quality to match. It ranged from slightly visible to something you could taste on a daily basis.

Alright so that's the real Airbnb. It was nicer than I anticipated. Our host was an architect named Chimi and he was great. He hung a huge map of the neighborhood on one wall and labeled all of his favorite places. They were all good. If you see Chimi, do something aggressively American to express your appreciation to him in a culturally insensitive way (don't though).

The apartment was confusingly on the border Hipodromo and Contessa, both borough-level neighborhoods. Contessa is the Mission of Mexico City if you trust the Google. It's not a horrible analogy, it's vaguely hipster with a lot of bars and young, affluentish Turd Furgesons.

Most of the D.F. that I saw looked something like the above. Somewhat cheaply built 2 - 6 story buildings, intermixed with bright colors, some newer construction, lots of trees, and street surfaces in moderate repair. Also, bike lanes. Mexico City appears to be appreciate the bicycle, though I can't imagine it's particularly enjoyable cycling at 7,000 feet with awful air quality.

Despite the less-than-great air quality, green is everywhere. The greenscape (is that a thing) is dry and crunchy, while still being lush. It's a funny dichotomy, everything looks greener than it feels. Still, it's beautiful.

The food. Hot damn, the food. It's good. It's all meat and bread for the most part, so if that's not your standard diet it's going to hurt, but it's tasty. There are amazing sauces on everything, portions are reasonable. They have burritos but they're tiny and you get three! You can get an Al Pastor taco on the street for like a dollar and it's better than any taco you've ever had. I know this for a fact because I keep track of the tacos you eat.
