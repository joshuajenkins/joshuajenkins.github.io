I traveled to Mexico City in December 2013 for six nights. I'm still getting a feel for the best way to write about travel, but I've been told that making blanket statements is probably the best route. In the spirit of being principled I will do my best to describe this city of nearly twenty-million people in homogenous platitudes. I knew literally nothing about Mexico D.F. before going there. Now I know figuratively nothing. Onward and upward.

### The air quality is poor
The air quality was the first thing I noticed about Mexico City. I thought we were flying through special yellow clouds as we descended towards the "aeruopuerto" (roughly, air door) but it turned out to be smog. As the city slowly came into focus I was a bit surprised by how pretty it was. From above, you see tree-lined boulevards and great parks which contrasts greatly with the smog.

On the ground the green is even more noticeable. The areas that we spent our time in were full of foliage. It always looked lush, but felt a bit dry and brittle. That's due partly to the altitude (7000+ emperial feet) and partly to the nasty air. Despite the visuals, the air quality would oscillate between somewhat noticeable to something you could actually taste. Tasting air is gross.

### The buildings are simple
This one is harder to articulate. To me, a lot of Mexico City feels like a European city in that it's very dense and full of midrise housing. However, the somewhat older buildings feel stripped of any ornamentation or detail and tend to be constructed entirely in right angles. It's somewhat harsh, but has a certain charm.

The building we stayed in was a bit brutal on the outside, but the inside was very nice and reminded me a lot of the apartment we stayed in in Barcelona. Except it didn't have heat, which turned out to be a matter of some concern in the middle of winter.

### No one speaks English
I can count the number of people I encountered that spoke English on one of my freaky eight-fingered hands, and I don't think I need more than five of those fingers. Coupled with my mild-for-the-US-but-apparently-un-mild-for-Mexico height and ragingly white skin, I was the most obvious tourist in the entire city. My tiny Spanish vocabularly failed me time and time again when I would apparently butcher words like "grac√≠as" to the point that they were gibberish. I did get pretty good at saying "sin hielo."

### The food is good
Of course the food is good. Mexican food in the states has been pretty Americanized, the worst offender probably being the burrito or nachos (incidentally two my favorite foods). Food in Mexico city relies heavily on delicious, complex, and wildly varying sauces. Portions are smaller, tacos are drier (in a good way), and the beer is---well the beer is actually just a shitty.

### They have hipsters sort of
We stayed in "The Mission of Mexico City," which is the Contesa neighborhood. It has bars with chalkboard signs, vintage stores with overpriced bullshit, and tons of places to get a bespoke hand-crafted infused cocktails. Some of this stuff is the good kind of hipster, which I will neatly categorize as establishments that put an extreme amount of care into the quality of their prodcuts. More of it was poor imitations, which are places that simply want to appear to be whatever passes for cool.

My favorite hipster establishment was a bar called The Monkey in Roma Norte. It had a good DJs and good cocktails. The semi-eponymous cocktail called Monkey Bubbles was my favorite. It's made with champagne, mezcal (everything in DF has mezcal in it), and something they burnt and dropped in that I can't quite remember. If that description doesn't get you pumped the fuck to travel to DF I truly don't know what will.

### Stray observations
- The Anthropology museum is tremenondous in size and in quality. Highly recommended.
- The taxis are (probably) safe to hail in the street. Don't let the blogs scare you too much. Don't negotiate a price beforehand, it'll definitely be more expensive than just running the meter.
- Downtown is fucking crazy. Super packed, super stressful. I'd only go if you want to check out the Mayan ruins which are admittedly cool as hell (the city has been continually established for two-thousand years (fact check this))
- La Casa Azul, a museum celebrating Frida Kahlo in her former home is powerful and enlightening.
- Al pastor tacos are a must, knucklehead.
- Stay in one of Chimi's Airbnbs. He is great.
