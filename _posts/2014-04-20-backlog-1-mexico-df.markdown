I traveled to Mexico City in December 2013 for six nights. I'm still getting a feel for the best way to write about travel, but I've been told that making blanket statements is probably the best route. In the spirit of being principled I will do my best to describe this city of nearly twenty-million people in homogenous platitudes. I knew literally nothing about Mexico D.F. before going there. Now I know figuratively nothing. Onward and upward.

### The air quality was not good
The air quality was the first thing I noticed about Mexico City. I thought we were flying through special yellow clouds as we descended towards the "aeruopuerto" (roughly, air door) but it turned out to be smog. As the city slowly came into focus I was a bit surprised by how pretty it was. From above, you see tree-lined boulevards and great parks which contrasts greatly with the smog.

On the ground the green is even more noticeable. The areas that we spent our time in were full of foliage. It always looked lush, but felt a bit dry and brittle. That's due partly to the altitude (7000+ emperial feet) and partly to the nasty air. Despite the visuals, the air quality would oscillate between somewhat noticeable to something you could actually taste. Tasting air is gross.

### The buildings are basic
This one is harder to articulate. To me, a lot of Mexico City feels like a European city in that it's very dense and full of midrise housing. The difference is that the buildings seems to be cheaply built, but still manage to carry that air. Many buildings would have the massing of something vaguely European but wouldn't have the balconies, the details, or the materials.

The build we stayed in was a bit brutal on the outside, but the inside was very nice and reminded me a lot of the apartment we stayed in in Barcelona. Except it didn't have heat, which turned out to matter in the middle of winter.
