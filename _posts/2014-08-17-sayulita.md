description: A week was spent in Sayulita. It was hot but there is an ocean there. I took some photos and wrote some words.
---

I have returned, triumphantly, alive, after a week in 90+ degree heat in and around Sayulita, Mexico. I only spent one day in bed with the Montezuma and hid from the sun for a dozen or two hours at the maximum. I swam in the ocean, stood up on a (stand-up) paddleboard, and ate tacos. I had a couple margaritas. I do not fancy myself a photographer. I have applied filters, poor framing, and captions to the following.

<a href="#recommendations">Recommendations</a> have also been put forth.

{: .big-image }
This is Sayulita. The road forks here to the two main ocean-parallel streets. The town is dense, filled with delicious food, surf shops, tourist crap, and margaritas. And people and street dogs.

![Thatched roof](/img/2014-sayulita/sayulita 2-26.jpg "Thatched roof")
{: .image }
Much time was spent looking at the construction of thatched roofs in this or that palapa. The support structures are always made of irregular wood, which is interesting—how is the wood selected? is it from a store? how is it structurally sound?

Surfing was attempted.

An oasis, north of the river, exists along the beach with sufficient shade and breeze to survive the brutally hot afternoons.

![Estrela](/img/2014-sayulita/sayulita 22-26.jpg "Estrela")
{: .image }
At night you can drink fruity Mezcal with the owner of the bar above the Oxxo on the beach. It's called Estela and it is worthy of your patronage.
{: .caption }

![29](/img/2014-sayulita/sayulita 17-26.jpg "29")
{: .image }
Or you can celebrate 29th birthdays with beer because champagne is hard to find.
{: .caption }

![BTTF III](/img/2014-sayulita/sayulita 3-26.jpg "BTTF III")
{: .image }
Or you can watch Back To The Future III in the restaurant next to the one with the really pushy server.
{: .caption }

![Bolero](/img/2014-sayulita/megan/sayulita 9-12.jpg "Bolero")
{: .image }
Or you can listen to traditional Bolero music on the street at Mezcalito with the very hammered, very emotionally touched bartenders.
{: .caption }

![Table on the street](/img/2014-sayulita/megan/sayulita 3-12.jpg "Table on the street")
{: .image }
Or you can simply sit at a street table at any number of restaurants.

"NAY." is short for Nayarit, the state we were in. The rest is in English.

Sayulita is a bit overwhelming in terms of places to try and things to do, and recommendations from the locals should be served with a salted rim, so I offer you these mild notes from our trip.
{: #recommendations }

 - **Estela**—Bar above Oxxo on the beach. San Francisco vibes. Great cocktails, killer view. The owner is great.
 - **Medusa**—North of the river on the second street in. The place is adorable. The fish is pretty good.
 - **Don Pedro's**—By far the best food I ate on the beach in Sayulita. Surprisingly good fish sandwich. They have cabanas for a small fee or minimum order.
 - **Not going in August**—While it being the off-season makes it easy to go places (that aren't closed for the season), it is borderline unbearably hot from 11am to 5pm. Though, you can hide at:
 - **Junto del Rio**—Just north of the river on the beach. Reliably cooler than anywhere else outside, with good drinks and guacamole.
 - **Yeikame**—Little hole in the wall traditional Mexican place in the town. Nothing mind blowing, just super solid.
 - **Sayulita Cafe**—Amazing mole (two syllables). This place is a little touristy (we were assaulted on the beach by the very eager "owner" asking us to come), but well worth it for the mole.
 - **Mezcalito**—Tiny divey bar in town. This is where we saw the Bolero band. The bartenders are awesome. Just feels like a good place.
 - **Pedritos**—Little taco place. Simple, but good.
 - **Tacos al Ivan**—Tacos Al Pastor. It must be done.
 - **El Tigre Surf School**—On the beach. There are many places to rent various boards, we chose this one on a recommendation from the owner of Estela. Much enjoyed. Did not make me feel like an asshole for being terribly stupid about aquatic planks.
 - **Stand-up Paddle Boarding**—Harder and more fun than it looks.
 - **Plain bread**—You know, in case Montezuma hangs out for a bit.
 - **Monchi's**—The bar is vaguely marijuana themed, in all the tackiness that conjures, but there are more interesting margaritas here than most places. Try the habanero mango margarita. Or don't, whatever.
 - **The bus to/from PVR**—You can take a bus from the airport to Sayulita. It's kind of horrible, kind of awesome. They blast weird music (80's power ballads on the way in) and it's absurdly cheap. Live a full life.
 - **San Francisco/San Pancho**—One place with two names. The next town north, a ten or fifteen minute drive or cab ride. Smaller than Sayulita. A chiller vibe with better food.
 - **Bistro Organico (San Francisco)**—I have some shame saying this was the best food we ate in or around Sayulita, but it was. Super fresh food, well plated, a little upscale, but good as hell. I had the best huevos rancheros I've ever had there. The patio is rustic-chill-modern-dwell-magazine.
 - **La Perla (San Pancho)**—One of maybe 3 restaurants on the beach in San Franciscopancho. They have fresh snapper. Most places just have mahi-mahi. Snapper is the better fish, and they treat it well.
