I traveled to Mexico City with Megan in December 2013 and I'm writing this in July 2014. This is an attempt to document it before it all fades away. Presented in multiple parts.
{: .note }

I can't recall ever hearing anyone talk about Mexico City in my life before going there. Particularly not as a travel destination. America has a weird "Mexico is dangerous" narrative that somehow renders invisible this massive, historic, and physically close city.

Selecting Mexico City as the destination for our generally only once yearly international trip wasn't a particularly informed decision. We chose it because it's big and it's close, and I was very curious.

Our flight arrived from Miami in mid-afternoon the day after Christmas. A slow descent throughh layers of smog slowly gave way to remarkable expanses of the massive city settled on a long-dry lakebed some seven-thousand feet high. The brief aerial glimpse of a place you'll be exploring from a wholly different context is one of the small parts about travel I love the most. From up high I saw a city of reddish roofs, tree-lined boulevards, and big parks.

I welcomed the familiar mix of excitement and trepadation I've come to know by traveling to a place I know little about, whose language I do not speak, whose customs I do not know.

We landed at the airport without incident, spent a noticeable amount of our finite vacation time in line for customs, breezed past the customs agent, and exchanged some American money for massively more pesos.

Overawareness and acute cultural ignorance start to kick in at this point. How much money should I exchange? How cheap is it really here? Am I going to get mugged? How out of whack is my expectation of spending in regards to normal folks here? Questions not dwelled upon, but anxiously considered and discarded.

In doing very light research before going to Mexico City I learned that taxis are the one thing to be legitimately on the lookout for. In particulary, there are green, unlicensed taxis called "parrots" which seem to be the ones exceeding on the abduction and robbery scale. The way you get a cab from MEX is by going to a kiosk and purchasing a ticket to a zone for a random amount of money (as all cab rides turn out to be in Mexico City), walk out a gate, and just kind of get in whatever car some person that may or not be officially sanctioned tells you to get in.

Our taxi doesn't look like a parrot, it's the ugly silver and maroon color most taxis are in Mexico City, but this all happens quickly enough to put me on edge.

We give our driver our address which is fairly which means much less than a burrough and major cross streets, which we begin heading for, probably. It's warm, so we have the window down, and the air quality is not great. We're in a sketchy-ish part of town, as all airports seem to be, and we are so clearly tourists. I'm nervous. The guy is driving a little crazy, he keeps looking in the rear-view mirror, probably to check for cars behind us, but perhaps also to see how much he can Versace I'm wearing (little to none).

We spend a while driving through sunken highways until emerging on surface streets in Hidalgo. Technically this is the district we stayed in, though we spent most of our time in Condesa, which is about 2 blocks away. The streets are lined with trees, there are cafes and restaurants everywhere, people are casually milling about, and my nerves finally settle down.

Our Airbnb's buzzer doesn't work and there's a bank across the street with an armed guard moving money that briefly freaks Megan out and we have a quick relapse into oh-shitness until our host emerges and lets us into the apartment. It's beautiful. He's an architect, so it's probably not a representative home, but it's nice and clean, simply decorated, and feels generally like any apartment you'd see in any city, just bigger and without heat [link to airbnbs].

We settle for a moment and set out.

The residential streets tend to be full of large, four to six story apartment buildings, charming despite being cheaply built and lacking in detail. Ten to twenty story buildings suddenly jutting up are not infrequent, nor are supermarkets and pharmacies adorned with brightly lit printed plastic signage. There are many restaurants and shops, some of which are small recesses cut into a building with a business haphazardly set inside, while others are entirely indestinguishable from any American shop. The mixture is rich and constantly interesting. There are pockets of street vendors selling anything from tacos to bootleg DVDs from place to place, tending to congregate near transit centers.

There are hatchback taxis with silver and maroon livery everywhere. Most look fine, but some are in disrepair and spew smoke. There's a lot of car traffic and there are many motorcycles and scooters. Mexico City has a city-wide bike share program and you see the large racks of red ecobici bikes routinely, with bicycle traffic to match. There's a fixed bus system on a few streets that seems quite bustling, though we never took it.

All of that is to say is that it felt like any dense, large city. It seemed to work well and was efficient. I stupidly expected something closer to third world but it is clearly first world, at least the portions that we saw. Compared to the standard car-dependant suburban American city, it was a breath of fresh air. Figuratively, because the air was not fresh.

We walked for about half an hour along a busy boulevard (Insurgentes) and then cut our way to Obrogon street in Colonia Roma. Roma is an upscale residential neighborhood bordering Condesa. We had a beer on the sidewalk at a restaurant on the street. The street had nice lights that lit up the trees on the sidewalk. We drank our beer, acclimated to the altitude and air quality, until it was time to go to Maximo Bistrot for one of two reservations we actually planned ahead for.

That leads to reflections on the food in Mexico City, which will be the next post.


### Finish describing the vibe, pt 2 can be food and drink, pt 3 can be neighborhoods?
