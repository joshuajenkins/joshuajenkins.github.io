description: A few words about a week-long trip to Mexico City in December, 2013.
---

I traveled to Mexico City with Megan in December 2013 and I'm writing this in August 2014. This is an attempt to document it before it all fades away. Presented in multiple parts.

I can't recall hearing anyone talk about Mexico City before I went there. America, so far as I can tell, has a peculiar disinterest in Mexico beyond the border towns and the coastal party spots.

Choosing Mexico City for one of our infrequent international trips was, in no way, an informed decision. My interest stemmed from general awareness of a bigger-than-NYC city not too far away. Couple that with it being cheaper than going overseas and a vacation is born.

Layers of smog slowly gave way to remarkable expanses of urbanization as we descended into Mexico City. As soon as the city revealed itself through the opaque smog I could see nothing but populized land all the way to the horizon. The massive city rests on a lakebed some seven-thousand feet above sea level.

The descent brought upon the familiar feeling of excitement and trepadation I've come to know by traveling to a place I know little about, whose language I do not speak, whose customs I do not know.

We landed at the airport without incident, spent a noticeable amount of our finite vacation time in line for customs, breezed past the customs agent, and exchanged some American money for massively more pesos.

In doing very light research before going to Mexico City I fear-learned that taxi selection is to be taken non-casually. In particular, there are green, unlicensed taxis called "parrots" which seem to be the ones exceeding on the abduction and robbery scale. The way you get a cab from MEX is by going to a kiosk and purchasing a ticket to a zone for a random quantity of pesos (as all cab rides turn out to be in Mexico City), walk out a gate, and just kind of get in whatever car some possibly official person tells you to get in to.

Our taxi doesn't look like a parrot, it's the aesthetically offensive gold and maroon color most taxis are in Mexico City. We get in, and then rapid flow from wondering how to get a taxi to being in this particular taxi happens quickly enough to put me on edge.

The address we offer our drivers means nothing to him. We fumble with bad Spanish and zero sense of geography before striking success with our updated offering of a burrough and major cross streets.

It's warm, so we have the windows down. We're in a maybe-sketchy part of town, as all airports seem to be, and we are clearly tourists (a rare sight in Mexico City). The driver keeps looking in the rear-view mirror, probably to check for cars, but perhaps to ascertain our abductability to profit ratio. I'm nervous.

We spend a while driving through sunken highways before emerging on surface streets in Hidalgo. Technically this is the district we stayed in, though we spent most of our time next door in Condesa. The streets are lined with trees, there are cafes and restaurants everywhere, people are casually milling about, it feels similar to any neighborhood in any large city I've been to. My nervousness is quickly displaced by pent-up excitement about eating nothing but tacos for a week.

Our Airbnb's buzzer doesn't work. There's a bank across the street with an armed guard outside that briefly causes us to relapse into oh-shitness, because lamely we just see a man with gun, until our host emerges and lets us into the apartment.

It's beautiful. He's an architect, so it's probably not a representative home, but it's nice and clean, simply decorated, and feels generally like any apartment you'd see in any city, just bigger and without heat.

Mexico City's residential streets are full of large, four to six story apartment buildings, charming despite being cheaply built and lacking in detail. Taller buildings are erratically mixed in, as well as bright white and primary colored supermarkets and pharmacies. There are plenty of restaurants and shops, some of which are small recesses cut into a building with a business thinly attached inside, while others are entirely indestinguishable from any American shop. The mixture is rich and constantly interesting. Here and there are pockets of street vendors selling anything from tacos to bootleg DVDs.

Trees and foliage are everywhere. Despite it's latitude, it's not a tropical environment. It's altitude gives it more of a crunchy, forest feeling. The greens you see are dark, and there's a noticable crispness to everything.

There are hatchback taxis with gold and maroon livery everywhere. Most look fine, but some are a mess and spew smoke. There's a lot of car, motorcycle, and scooter traffic. Mexico City has a city-wide bike share program and you see the large racks of red ecobici bikes routinely, with bicycle traffic to match. There's a fixed bus system on a few streets that seems bustling, though we never took it.

All of that is to say is that it felt like any dense, large city. It seems effecient and coherent. I stupidly expected something less put together because I'm a horrible American. Compared to the standard car-dependant suburban American city, it was a breath of fresh air. Figuratively, because the air quality was horrible.
