Today is my ten-thousandth day alive. I find most anniversaries arbitrary and unworthy of celebration because, metaphorically, my insides are dead. Yet, something about a one a five zeroes interests me. A more visually interesting marker than years, at the very least.

If you've aged less than twenty-seven and a half or so years, you have your ten-thousandth day ahead of you. Put in your birthday below to figure it out. Click/tap the month and year headings to jump quickly.

<section id="10k-module" class="module">
  <div class="inside">
    <input type="text" id="10k-datepicker" placeholder="Date of birth">
    <div class="results"></div>

</section>
