description: Faint memories from a trip to Sweden
---

In December, 2012 I went to Sweden with my mom, my grandfather, and my girlfriend. My mom's side of the family is Swedish-ish, her being half Swedish and my grandfather on (until you get to monkeys, presumably) being fully Swedish. None of us had been to Sweden, so this was something of a familial anthropological excursion.

In what can only be described as a horrible miscalculation, a series of very noticeable Abba paraphernalia await you at the otherwise pleasant Arlanda airport outside of Stockholm. Expectations were set and subsequently, thankfully, missed in regards to Abba encounters.

We stayed in Södermalm, the analog of The Mission or Williamsburg, as one does. This is what our two block Subway to Airbnb walk looked like. At something like 5pm. December is a "clutch" time to visit Stockholm—the capital of the Arctic Circle—as the locals say.

Our Airbnb was this beautiful little apartment on a small hill at the edge of Södermalm. It was full of gorgeous furniture, artwork, and this shiny coffee cube.

Given the weather (cold), and the amount of daylight per day (little), we spent a lot of our time doing what I learned to do during winters in Portland: walk around and alternatingly drink coffee and alcohol. Luckily for us Stockholm is obnoxiously beautiful, so we were entertained.

You've got your beautiful old European stuff mixed with modern stuff generally covered in snow:

You've got your cultural institutions sprinkled with family members:

You've got soul-enriching views of water at basically all times:

You have a surprisingly large number of food options in huts:

Also food indoors:

But best of all you have utter and complete darkness for the vast majority of each day which is enchantingly counteracted by ever-present lights hanging from streets, along bridges, and glowing from within countless shops and homes.

Stockholm is a magical place where I want to spend much more time. Hop around islands with spectacular views from tastefully designed place to tastefully designed place. The food is amazing, the transportation is highly functional, and the weather is the envy of the tropics.

In closing, these are some trains and birds:
