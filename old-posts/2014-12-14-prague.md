description: The Žižkov Tower and less interesting things about Prague.
---

So Prague is old and European and has a shitload of churches and is obsessed with its old relics that celebrate perverse power structures which is all fine and good, but it also also has a relatively modern penis that totally overshadows all the old penises and it is great. It is called the Žižkov Television Tower and it is without a doubt the best thing in Prague. This is my love note.

The Žižkov is a member of the World Federation of Great Towers whose member-penises range from decorative to marginally functional. Impressive feats of engineering and one-upsmanship that can completely dominate a quaint old-world skyline like Prague’s. I am sympathetic to the highest point in the city being a tacky marvel of recent engineering rather than a big ass church, of which Prague has scores. Oh, and it has a bunch of creepy baby statues crawling all over it, designed by Czech sculptor David Černý. He's the same guy that did this [incredible moving statue](http://instagram.com/p/wjYxQ9hGC5).

At night the tower reasserts its dominance with a series of colored lights that continually reminded me of the Empire State Building. It also houses a single room hotel that appears to go for about $1100 per night. The grounds host a “professional miniature golf course” which is, in fact, a put-put golf course. The golf course as well as the tower are rumored to have been built upon portions of the adjacent Jewish cemetery. This is a Soviet-era structure.

You can see this thing from basically everywhere. Prague Castle tries, pathetically, to be the most visible thing in the city, but you can totally see Žižkov Tower from Prague Castle.

Otherwise, Prague is a sea of six-story European apartment buildings, bad cafes, flood light-lit churches, and a smattering of really nice coffee shops. And one massive ostentatious church on top of a hill.

In summation, here is a Prague compliment sandwich:

It's super old and beautiful.

It's touristy and everyone smokes and there's dog shit and human puke everywhere.

They have a really cool trash and recycling system. There are big pits underneath the normal-looking cans found every few blocks that everything drops into. Neat.

These are the places I liked in Prague:
 
- **EMA Espresso Bar**—The coffee shop pictured a few photos above. One of the bigger super-hip coffee shops. Great coffee, great design, and they have this thing that's like a pie on pizza dough.
- **Taverna Olympos**—Extremely good Greek place in Žižkov. One of the more upscale places we ate at (Prague is cheap so it's still super resonable). Get the fried goat cheese with sesame seeds and honey to start. The rest is irrelevant.
- **La Bohème Café**—Great coffee / tea shop. Anthropologie vibes. Coffee set up is legit. Great work spot. They have a  subtle cognac and coffee drink, aptly called Coffee Cognac. Try one.
- **Dish {fine dining bistro}**—The curly braces in the title are consistent with the faux-fancy airs at this place, but the burgers are good. Prepare yourself for fine-dining burgers. It's weird. For some reason they have a gin & tonic selection.
- **Bukowski's**—Neighborhood cocktail bar. This is probably one of my favorite bars I've ever been to. Felt like Portland. Cocktails occupy a space between shitty dive bar cocktails and overpriced slap-your-wrist-with-basil cocktails. Gets packed and it's full of smokers, but it's cozy and young humans with good haircuts go there.
- **Coffee Room.**—Very neighborhoody coffee spot. Has about three tables, but isn't particularly popular. One day we had the place to ourselves and worked for a few hours, one day we shared the place with screaming babies and loud tourists. Mileage may vary, but worth a shot.
- **Mr. Banh Mi**—Tasty Banh Mi. Great little lunch spot.
- **The Tavern**—Best burgers in Prague probably. Cool, extremely-popular corner spot on a park. Lots of little winks to American culture like "Big American-Size Coke".
- **Sausage Stand Next to Prague Castle**—Prague Castle, should you choose to walk there, is an exhausting exercise in abject tourism. There's a little sausage stand near the western entrance where you can get a cheap sausage and a beer and just chill out on the steps nearby and recooperate.
- **Original Coffee**—Perhaps the only non-stressful place in Old Town? Another good coffee shop, this one is in the thick of it.
- **BeerGeek Bar**—Craft beer bar. Tons of taps. In a basement and has sort of a dorky vibe, but the beer is otherwise horrible in Prague so it's worth a stop.
- **Oblaca Bar**—In Žižkov tower. It's like a hotel bar. Except it's way the hell above everything else in Prague. We went on a Saturday night and it was empty. I don't think people like it. I had a legitimately good cocktail for $7. If you only go to one place, go here.
