<h4 class="inline-title">Wall-Mounted Pendant Lamp</h4>
<img class="inline" src="/img/projects/lamp.jpg">
<p class="description">Inspired by a pendant lamp display we saw in a store, we built this over a couple of days with a handsaw and an underpowered cordless drill. Happy to share basic plans if there's any interest.</p>
<p>The lampshade is from Ikea, the cord will soon be replaced by one with a clicker in a woven enclosure.</p>
