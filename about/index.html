<p>I moved to San Francisco from Portland in 2011. Immediately before that I lived in eight other states and was born. I&rsquo;m working at <a href="http://last.co" title="The Last Guide Company">The Last Guide Co.</a> on some cool shit. I spent two and a half years designing at Dropbox, where I helped launch a bunch of early <a href="http://dropbox.com/developers" title="Dropbox Platform">Dropbox Platform</a> products.</p>
<p>If you like any of the typing that you&rsquo;ve noticed, I deeply, deeply urge you to <a href="http://twitter.com/joshuajenkinsyo" title="Follow me on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>
