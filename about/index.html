<p>I moved to San Francisco from Portland in 2011. Immediately before that I lived in eight other states and was born. Since early 2012 I&rsquo;ve been designing at Dropbox, where I&rsquo;ve helped launch a good deal of the early Dropbox Platform products. Now I focus on internal tools. I recently learned to type.</p>
<p>If you like any of the typing that you&rsquo;ve noticed, I deeply, deeply urge you to <a href="http://twitter.com/joshuajenkinsyo">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>
