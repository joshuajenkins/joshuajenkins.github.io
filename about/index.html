<h2>About (I am required by law to have this page)</h2>
<span class="divider"></span>

<p><img class="inline-photo" src="/img/photo-barca.jpg">I moved to San Francisco from Portland in 2011. Immediately before that I lived in eight other states and was born. I&rsquo;m working at <a href="http://last.co" title="The Last Guide Company">The Last Guide Co</a>. I spent over two years designing at Dropbox, where I helped launch a bunch of early <a href="http://dropbox.com/developers" title="Dropbox Platform">Dropbox Platform</a> products.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by using the same tools to create art that I use to make products. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m helping out with <a href="http://uncontext.com" title="Uncontext">Uncontext</a>. I made <a href="http://www.uncontext.com/literature/shape" title="Shape">this</a> and I will share more soon.</p>

<p>This website exists because I want to have a place to keep things. It also challenges me to reflect and write.</p>
